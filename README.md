# DataScience-COVID-19

## Project description

The implementation of a data mart to map not only the details of individuals who tested positive for Covid-19, but also to assess lifestyle changes of Canadians during the Covid-19 pandemic.


## Phase#1: Conceptual Design - Dimensional model

During the phase, our aim was to Create a dimensional model detailing our initial design of the Covid-19 tracking and lifestyle trends data mart. So we needed to identify the different ata sources we can use, and then construct the dimensional model.


## Phase#2: Physical Design and data staging

In this phase we needed to create our data mart using the PostgreSQL database management system by following the data staging steps to populate the data mart.


## Phase#3: OLAP Queries and BI Dashboard 

The goal of this phase was to explore the data by using OLAP queries and to create a Business Intelligence Dashboard to visualize trends by using tableau


## Phase#4: Data mining

During this final step we needed to explore the data using data mining techniques, the process included data summarization, Data preprocessing and feature selection, classification (supervised learning), and finally detection of outliers
